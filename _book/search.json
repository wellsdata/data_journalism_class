    "text": "Welcome to data journalism. The main goal of this course is to expand your ability to report and tell stories using data. You will use these tools to discover trends in data. You will learn how to create and publish graphics and maps. It’s hard work but it is a lot of fun and very rewarding.\nWe have some basic goals for you to reach in this class. By the end of the semester, we want you to have basic proficiency and independence with data analysis. We want you to be able to write about data clearly, using the Associated Press style as a benchmark. We want you to be able to find and download a dataset, clean it up, visualize it.\nThe skills you will learn in the coming weeks are in high demand in journalism and beyond. Examine this BuzzFeed job description from 2017:\n“We’re looking for someone with a passion for news and a commitment to using data to find amazing, important stories — both quick hits and deeper analyses that drive conversations,” the posting seeking a data journalist says. It goes on to list five things BuzzFeed is looking for: Excellent collaborator, clear writer, deep statistical understanding, knowledge of obtaining and restructuring data.\n“You should have a strong command of at least one toolset that (a) allows for filtering, joining, pivoting, and aggregating tabular data, and (b) enables reproducible workflows.”\nYou will learn these skills in this book. You’ll get a taste of modern data journalism through Google Sheets and programming in R, a statistics language. You’ll be challenged to think programmatically while thinking about a story you can tell to readers in a way that they’ll want to read. Combining them together has the power to change policy and expose injustice.\n\n\nThis book begins with a basic review of Google Sheets and then shifts to the R statistical language. To follow along, you’ll do the following:\n\nInstall the R language on your computer. Go to the this website, click download R based on your operating system. If that link somehow doesn’t work, check R Project website and find a different location.\nInstall R Studio Desktop. The free version is great.\n\nGoing forward, you’ll see passages like this:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nThat is code that you’ll need to run common software packages in your R Studio.\n\n\n\nThis book is the collection of class materials compiled by various data journalism professors around the country: Matt Waite at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s College of Journalism and Mass Communications and Sarah Cohen of Arizona State University. This version was rewritten by Rob Wells, building on work by Sean Mussenden and Derek Willis, at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism.\nThere’s some things you should know about it:\n\nIt is free for students.\nThe topics will remain the same but the text is going to be constantly tinkered with.\nWhat is the work of the authors is copyright Rob Wells 2024, Sean Mussenden and Derek Willis 2022, Matt Waite 2020 and Sarah Cohen 2022.\nThe text is Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Creative Commons licensed.

    "text": "Getting started in data journalism often feels as if you’ve left the newsroom and entered the land of statistics, computer programming and data science. This chapter will help you start seeing data reporting in a new way, by learning how to study great works of the craft as a writer rather than a reader.\nJelani Cobb tweeted, “an engineer doesn’t look at a bridge the same way pedestrians or drivers do.” They see it as a “language of angles and load bearing structures.” We just see a bridge. While he was referring to long-form writing, reporting with data can also be learned by example – if you spend enough time with the examples.\nAlmost all good writers and reporters try to learn from exemplary work. I know more than one reporter who studies prize-winning journalism to hone their craft. This site will have plenty of examples, but you should stay on the lookout for others."

    "section": "2.1 Read like a reporter",
    "text": "2.1 Read like a reporter\nTry to approach data or empirical reporting as a reporter first, and a consumer second. The goal is to triangulate how the story was discovered, reported and constructed. You’ll want to think about why this story, told this way, at this time, was considered newsworthy enough to publish when another approach on the same topic might not have been.\n\nWhat were the questions?\nIn data journalism, we often start with a tip, or a hypothesis. Sometimes it’s a simple question. Walt Bogdanich of The New York Times is renowned for seeing stories around every corner. Bogdanich has said that the prize-winning story “A Disability Epidemic Among a Railroad’s Retirees” came from a simple question he had when railway workers went on strike over pension benefits – how much were they worth? The story led to an FBI investigation and arrests, along with pension reform at the largest commuter rail in the country.\nThe hypothesis for some stories might be more directed. In 2021, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at ASU published “Little victims everywhere”, a set of stories on the lack of justice for survivors of child sexual assault on Native American reservations. That story came after previous reporters for the center analyzed data from the Justice Department showing that the FBI dropped most of the cases it investigated, and the Justice Department then only prosecuted about half of the matters referred to it by investigators. The hypothesis was that they were rarely pursued because federal prosecutors – usually focused on immigration, white collar crime and drugs – weren’t as prepared to pursue violent crime in Indian Country.\nWhen studying a data-driven investigation, try to imagine what the reporters were trying to prove or disprove, and what they used to do it. In journalism, we rely on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. It’s not enough to prove the “numbers” or have the statistical evidence. That is just the beginning of the story. We are supposed to ground-truth them with the stories of actual people and places.\n\n\nGo beyond the numbers\nIt’s easy to focus on the numbers or statistics that make up the key findings, or the reason for the story. Some reporters make the mistake of thinking all of the numbers came from the same place – a rarity in most long-form investigations. Instead, the sources have been woven together and are a mix of original research and research done by others. Try to pay attention to any sourcing done in the piece. Sometimes, it will tell you that the analysis was original. Other times it’s more subtle.\nBut don’t just look at the statistics being reported in the story. In many (most?) investigations, some of the key people, places or time elements come directly from a database.\nSarah Cohen at Arizona State University analyzed the Paycheck Protection Program loan data for ProPublica and found a handful of sketchy-looking records from a single county in coastal New Jersey. It turned out to be a pretty good story.\nOften, the place that a reporter visits is determined by examples found in data. In this story on rural development funds, all of the examples came from an analysis of the database. Once the data gave us a good lead, the reporters examined press releases and other easy-to-get sources before calling and visiting the recipients or towns."

Could they have come from the data?\nWhat do you think came first – a narrative single example that was broadened by data (naively, qualitative method), or a big idea that was illustrated with characters (quantitative method)?\nWhat records were used? Were they public records, leaks, or proprietary data?\nWhat methods did they use? Did they do their own testing, use statistical analysis, or geographic methods? You won’t always know, but look for a methodology section or a description alongside each story.\nHow might you localize or adapt these methods to find your own stories?\nPick out the key findings (usually in the nut graf or in a series of bullets after the opening chapter): are they controversial? How might they have been derived? What might have been the investigative hypothesis? Have they given critics their due and tried to falsify their own work?\nHow effective is the writing and presentation of the story? What makes it compelling journalism rather than a dry study? How might you have done it differently? Is a video story better told in text, or would a text story have made a good documentary? Are the visual elements well integrated? Does the writing draw you in and keep you reading? Think about structure, story length, entry points and graphics all working together.\nAre you convinced? Are there holes or questions that didn’t get addressed?"

We’re seeking stories, not studies. Recognizing news in data is one of the hardest skills for less experienced reporters new to data journalism. This list of potential newsworthy data points is adapted from Paul Bradshaw’s “Data Journalism Heist”.\n\n\n\n\nCompare the claims of powerful people and institutions against facts – the classic investigative approach.\nReport on unexpected highs and lows (of change, or of some other characteristic)\nLook for outliers – individual values that buck a trend seen in the rest\nVerify or bust some myths\nFind signs of distress, happiness or dishonesty or any other emotion.\nUncover new or under-reported long-term trends.\nFind data suggesting your area is the same or different than most others of its kind.\n\nBradshaw also did a recent study of data journalism pieces: “Here are the angles journalists use most often to tell the stories in data”, in Online Journalism Blog. I’m not sure I agree, only because he’s looking mainly at visualizations rather than stories, but they’re worth considering."

In 2012, Bayonne Medical Center “charged the highest amounts in the country for nearly one-quarter of the most common hospital treatments,” the Times story said.\nTo do this story, McGinty only needed to know the number of the procedures reported to the government and the total amount each hospital charged. Dividing those to find an average price, then ranking the most common procedures, led to this surprising result."

It may have been charming at one time for reporters to announce that they didn’t “do” math, but no longer. Instead, it is now an announcement that the reporter can only do some of the job. You will never be able to tackle complicated, in-depth stories without reviewing basic math.\nThe good news is that most of the math and statistics you need in a newsroom isn’t nearly as difficult as high school algebra. You learned it somewhere around the 4th grade. You then had a decade to forget it before deciding you didn’t like math. But mastering this most basic arithmetic again is a requirement in the modern age.\nIn working with typical newsroom math, you will need to learn how to:\n\nOvercome your fear of numbers\nIntegrate numbers into your reporting\nRoutinely compute averages, differences and rates\nSimplify and select the right numbers for your story\n\nWhile this chapter covers general tips, you can find specific instructions for typical newsroom math in this Appendix A, an except from Sarah Cohen’s outstanding book, Numbers in the Newsroom."

    "text": "3.2 Overcoming your fear of math\nWhen we learned to read, we got used to the idea that 26 letters in American English could be assembled into units that we understand without thinking – words, sentences, paragraphs and books. We never got the same comfort level with 10 digits, and neither did our audience.\nIn modern reporting, we’re dealing with huge numbers, in the millions and billions. Think of ways to put these figures into context for everyday people. For example, a million seconds goes by in about 11 days but you may not have been alive for a billion seconds – about 36 years.\nThe easiest way to get used to some numbers is to learn ways to cut them down to size by calculating rates, ratios or percentages. In your analysis, keep an eye out for the simplest accurate way to characterize the numbers you want to use. “Characterize” is the important word here – it’s not usually necessary to be overly precise so long as your story doesn’t hinge on a nuanced reading of small differences.\nHere’s one example of putting huge numbers in perspective. Pay attention to what you really can picture - it’s probably the $21 equivalent.\n\nThe Chicago hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, for example, earns about $68.5 million a month after taxes, according to court filings made by his wife in their divorce. He has given a total of $300,000 to groups backing Republican presidential candidates. That is a huge sum on its face, yet is the equivalent of only $21.17 for a typical American household, according to Congressional Budget Office data on after-tax income.  “Buying Power”, Nicholas Confessore, Sarah Cohen and Karen Yourish, The New York Times, October 2015\n\nOriginally the reporters had written it even more simply, but editors found the facts so unbelievable that they wanted give readers a chance to do the math themselves. That’s reasonable, but here’s an even simpler way to say it: “earned nearly $1 billion after taxes…He has given $300,000 to groups backing candidates, the equivalent of a dinner at Olive Garden for the typical American family , based on Congressional Budget Office income data.” (And yes, the reporter checked the price for an Olive Garden meal at the time for four people.)"

    "text": "3.3 Put math in its place\nFor journalists, numbers – or facts – make up the third leg of a stool supported by human stories or anecdotes , and insightful comment from experts. They serve us in three ways:\n\nAs summaries. Almost by definition, a number counts something, averages something, or otherwise summarizes something. Sometimes, it does a good job, as in the average height of Americans. Sometimes it does a terrible job, as in the average income of Americans. Try to find summaries that accurately characterize the real world.\nAs opinions. Sometimes it’s an opinion derived after years of impartial study. Sometimes it’s an opinion tinged with partisan or selective choices of facts. Use them accordingly.\nAs guesses. Sometimes it’s a good guess, sometimes it’s an off-the-cuff guess. Even when everything is presumably counted many times, it’s still a (very nearly accurate) guess. Yes, the “audits” of presidential election results in several states in 2021 found a handful of errors – not a meaningful number, but a few just the same.\n\nOnce you find the humanity in your numbers, by cutting them down to size and relegating them to their proper role, you’ll find yourself less fearful. You may even find that finding facts on your own is fun."

This is known as the Decennial Census and it is used to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, among other things.\nIn addition, the Census Bureau conducts ongoing survey of communities, known as the American Community Survey or ACS that provides more timely information about social, economic, housing, and demographic data every year. You can find information on housing, small business ownership, population profiles and much more. The ACS uses an annual sample size of about 3.5 million addresses and is collecting information daily.\nCongressional lawmakers look at the ACS data to determine distribution of federal spending, among other things. Read more about census data here\nHere’s something important to know about ACS results: Data are pooled across a calendar year. So the ACS numbers reflect data collected over a period of time. By contrast, the Decennial Census is a single point-in-time count of the population.\nWe will be using ACS data to examine trends in wealth and social issues in Baltimore neighborhoods because this survey provides detail not available yet in the Decennial Census.\nYou can access Census Data through multiple ways. The U.S. Census Bureau offers data.census.gov. Using this site requires some training and patience. Here is a good place to start, a presentation the Census Bureau staff made to the Investigative Reporters and Editors conference in 2019.\nAnother useful resource is censusreporter.org, a site not affiliated with the Census Bureau that’s designed to make it easier to navigate and retrieve the ACS data.\nWhen we use R, we will use a software library called tidycensus that makes it very easy to retrieve Census data from the Census API, or application programming interface, basically a raw data feed optimized for R, python and similar programs. Stay tuned on that later this semester.\nData journalist Paul Overberg, now with The Wall Street Journal, compiled this useful guide about terminology when dealing with Census data."

The exercises can be easily adapted to Microsoft Excel, which can handle larger datasets and has more options for pivot tables and other more advanced functions.

If you ever played Battleship, you’ll recognize the idea – every little square, or cell, is referenced by the intersection of its column letter and row number:\nB2 is the cell that is currently active. You can tell because it’s outlined in the sheet and it’s shown on the upper left corner.\n\n\nMouse shapes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Copy Tool, or the thin black cross. When you see this, you’ll copy anything that’s selected. This can be good or bad.\n\n\n\nThe Evil Hand. If you use this symbol, you will MOVE the selection to a new location. This is very rarely a good idea or something you intend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting cells and ranges\nSpreadsheets act only on the cells or regions you have selected. If you begin typing, you’ll start entering information into the currently selected cell.\nTo select: Hold the cursor over the cell and click ONCE – not twice. Check the formula bar to make sure you’ve selected what you think you’ve got. You can also look at the bottom right of your spreadsheet for more information.\nYou’ll often work with ranges of cells in formulas. These are defined by the corners of the area you want to work on – often a column of information. In the example below, the range is A1:C6, with the “:” referring to the word “through”.\nTo select a group of cells and act on them all at once: Hover the cursor over one corner, click ONCE and drag to the diagonal corner. Make sure the Evil Hand is nowhere to be seen. The entire area will be shaded in except for the currently selected cell. Look at the upper right corner to see how many rows and columns you selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select a column or row : Hover the cursor over the letter at the top of the column. For a row, hover it over the row number in the margin\n\n\nReading the screen\n\nThe areas of the spreadsheet have different visual clues, and learning to read them will make your life much easier.\nThis image shows some key areas on the screen when you’re just viewing the sheet:\n\n\n\nRead the Screen\n\n\nThis is how it changes when you’re editing\n\n\n\nEditing\n\n\n\nEntering data\nSelect the cell and start typing. The information you type won’t be locked into the cell until you hit the Return / Enter key, or move your selection to another cell. Hit “Escape” to cancel the entry.\nYou can’t do a lot of things while you’re editing, so if you have a lot of greyed out menu items, look at your formula bar to see if you are still editing a cell.\nIf you’re having trouble getting to a menu item or seeing the result of your work, try hitting “Escape” and try again. You may not have actually entered the information into the sheet.\n\n\nLocking in headings\nAs your spreadsheet grows vertically with more rows, you’ll want to be able to see the top all the time. When it grows horizontally with more columns, you’ll probably want to see columns in the left, such as names. This is called “Freezing Panes” – you freeze part of the page so it stays in place when you move around.\nSelect View in the menu, then Freeze, then the number of rows to freeze. Select 1 row. As you now scroll down the sheet, your headings will remain but you can see the data as you move deeper into the sheet.\n\n\n\nfreeze panes\n\n\n\n\nFormatting tricks\n\nUse the buttons or the format dialog box to make numbers easier to read.\nIf a column is filled with a lot of text, select Format, then Wrapping from the menu to wrap text. This means that when you double-click to widen a column, it will get taller, not wider. This is good when you need to save valuable real estate on the screen."

It will save time and stress on deadline.\nRead anything you can about what it contains.

Work on a copy.\nIf the spreadsheet shows #### instead of words or numbers, widen your columns. If it shows 7E-14 or something like that, format them as numbers, not “General”.\nCheck your corners – look at the top left and bottom right. Is the data all in one area? Are there footnotes or other non-data sections mixed in? We’re going to want to fix that later.\n\n\n\nInterview your data\n\nHeadings\nThe most fraught part of data reporting is understanding what each column actually means. These often have cryptic, bureaucratic names. You may need to go back to the source of the data to be sure you actually understand them.\nIf your data doesn’t have any headings, that’s going to be your first priority. In effect, you’ll need to build what we call a data dictionary or record layout if one hasn’t been provided. Many reporters create these as a page in a dataset.\n\n\nUnit of analysis\nA unit of analysis refers to the items that are listed in the rows of your dataset. Ideally, every row should be at the same unit of analysis – a person, an inspection, or a city, for example. Summaries should be separated by a blank row, or moved to a different sheet. Think of this as the noun you’d use to describe every row.\n\n\nRow numbers\nThe data was probably given to you in some sort of natural sort order. Different computer systems sort differently – some are case-sensitive, others are not. It may depend on when and where the data as created! The order of the data may even depend on a column you don’t have. If you don’t do something now, you’ll never be able to get back to the original order, which could have meaning for both the agency and for fact-checking."

Could there be news in the outliers on the list? Which departments most closely represented their communities? Which ones had unusually large gaps?\n\n\n\n\nChief William T. Riley III. Credit: Laura McDermott for The New York Times\n\n\n\nCohen quickly stumbled on telling anecdote to frame the story: Inkster, Mich. had one of the least representative departments in the country, and had recently hired a new police chief to help mend the department’s fraught relationship with its largely African-American community. Where had he come from? Selma, Ala., one of the most representative police departments in the nation. Interviews with the chief, William T. Riley III, suggested one reason for some cities’ disparities: there was no state or federal money to pay for training new police officers.\nThe story, “Police Chiefs, Looking to Diversity Forces, Face Structural Hurdles” helped explain the persistent gap between the makeup of police in some areas and the communities they served."

    "text": "7.3 Example data\nData from the Washington Post police shootings database for use in this tutorial - Documentation from the Post’s github site :::\n\nThe data for this and several other chapters is the Washington Post’s public data collection of police shootings in the U.S. It includes the nation’s best guess about each fatal police shooting since 2015. There are a couple of caveats:\nIt excludes deadly police interactions other than shooting a firarem at the suspect. Any strangulation, car crashes, Tasers without guns or other methods are excluded.\nIt is based primarily on news reports and the results public records requests so it often contains the story as told by police. We know that many of those reports are sugar-coated at best, and lies at worst.\nThe Post says this is a list of fatal shootings, but doesn’t say what happens if more than one person is killed. The 2019 shooting of D’Angelo Brown & Megan Rivera in West Memphis is shown as two rows1 in the data even though it was one event. So each row might be considered a shooting “victim”, a “suspect” or a shooting “fatality” rather than a “shooting”.\n\nThe screenshots in this tutorial may not match exactly to what you get on the Washington Post data. This tutorial used data current to Aug. 3, 2022.\nIt’s a good example set for us because it’s been used as the basis of many stories, it has at least one of each data type that we plan to deal with in Google Sheets, and it is well documented on the Post’s github site."

    "section": "7.5 Understanding data types",
    "text": "7.5 Understanding data types\nWhen you open the spreadsheet, the first thing to notice is its granularity. Unlike Census or budget spreadsheets, this is a list capturing specific characteristics of each fatality Each column has the same type of data from top to bottom. Those types are:\n\nText. Text or “character” columns can come in long or short form. When they are standardized (the values can contain only one of a small list of values), they’re called “categorical”. If they’re more free-form, they’re might be called “free text”. The computer doesn’t know the difference, but you should. The Post data has examples of both. In spreadsheets, text is left-justified (they move toward the left of the cell and will line up vertically at the beginning)\nNumbers. These are pure numbers with no commas, dollar signs or other embellishments. In Google Sheets, as we’ll see in the computing section, these can be formatted to look like numbers we care about , but underneath they’re just numbers. Adding up a column of numbers that has a word in it or has missing values will just be ignored in Google Sheets. It will trip up most other languages. These are right-justified, so the last digit is always lined up vertically.\nLogical: This is a subset of text. It can take one of only two values – yes or no, true or false. There is no “maybe”.\nDate and times: These are actual dates on the calendar, which have magical properties. Underneath, they are a number. In Google Sheets, that number is the number of days since Jan. 1, 1900.2 They can also have time attached to them, which in Google Sheets is a fraction of a day. What this means is that the number 44,536.5 is really Dec. 6, 2021 at noon. In Google Sheets, you use a format to tell the spreadsheet how you want to see the date or time, just the way you look at dollar values with commas and symbols. (If you get a spreadsheet with a lot of dates of 1/1/1900, it means there is a 0 in that column, which is sometimes a fill-in for “I don’t know.”)\n\nHere’s a picture of a date that is shown in a variety of formats.\n\n\n\ndate formats\n\n\nAll of these are the same, underlying value – the number at the left. Notice that all of these are right-justified.\nThis means that when you see “Friday, December 10”, the computer sees 44540.87431. When you put the dates in order, they won’t be alphabetized with all of the Fridays shown together. Instead, they’ll be arranged by the actual date and time.\nIt also means that you can compute 911 response times even when it crosses midnight, or or compute the someone’s age today given a date of birth. Keeping actual calendar dates in your data will give it much more power than just having the words. (Google Sheets uses the 1st of the month as a stand-in for an actual date when all you know is the month and year.)\n\n7.5.1 Sorting rows\nSorting means rearranging the rows of a data table into a different order. Some reporters take a conceptual shortcut and call this “sorting columns”. That thinking will only get you into trouble – it lets you forget that you want to keep the rows in tact while changing the order in which you see them. In fact, in other languages it’s called “order by” or “arrange” by one or more columns – a much clearer way to think of it.\nIn Google Sheets, look for the sort options under the Data tab at the top of your screen. In this case, sorting from oldest to newest gives you a list of the fatalities in chronological order, including the time of day.\nTo sort your data:\n\nMake a copy of your data. Left click on the “fatal-police-shootings-data” tab, select Duplicate\nSelect your data by clicking the box above Row 1 and to the left of Column A\nSelect Data | Sort Range | Advanced Range Sorting Options\nClick “Data has header row” and then select date from the Sort by dialog box. Select Z –> A\nSelect Sort\n\n\n\n\nAdding fields to the sort\nAdding more columns to the sort box tells Google Sheets what to do when the first one is the same or tied. For example, sorting first by state then by date gives you a list that shows all of the events by state in sequence:\n\n\n\n\n7.5.2 Filtering\nFiltering means picking out only some of the rows you want to see based on a criteria you select in a column. Think of it as casting a fishing net – the more filters you add, the fewer fish will be caught.\nTo activate filters in Google Sheets, from the Menu:\n\nData | Filter Views | Create a New Filter View\nYou’ll see little triangles next to the column headings.\n\nClick the “armed” heading. You will see options for various weapons. All are selected by default with a check mark. To select just “ax”, click on clear and then select “ax.” The sheet how is filtered to just weapons using an ax. To remove the filter, repeat the steps and “select all” and the entire sheet is displayed again.\nEach filter you select adds more conditions, narrowing your net.\nTo find fatalities that involved a firearm with a Taser, use the drop-down menu under manner_of_death select “shot and Tasered”.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method works for small-ish and simple-ish columns. If your column has more than 10,000 different entries, such as names or addresses, only the first 10,000 will be considered. We only caught these for stories when someone did a fact-check using a different method of filtering. If your column has a lot of distinct entries, use option that says “Choose One”, and then use the “Contains” option. Better yet, don’t use filtering for counting things at all.\nAdd more filters to narrow down your list of cases even more. For example, the New York Times ran a series of stories in 2021 about unarmed people shot by police. One story was about those who were fleeing by car. Here’s one way to get a preliminary list of those cases:\n\nRemove any filter you already have on.\nTurn on the filters again if you turned them off.\nChoose “unarmed” under armed and “car” under flee.\n\n(Of course, the Times didn’t stop there in trying to find more cases and teasing out more of them from this and other data. But this is a start. )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent kinds of filters\nThere are several filter options. You can filter by various conditions. For numerical data, you can set a minimum or maximum value or a range of values. This is useful for dates to specify a certain time period. For text, you can filter if a word contains a few letters, useful to capture spelling variations."

You begin using a function the same way you begin a formula – with an = sign. Here are three common functions that create summary statistics for the numbers contained in a range of addresses.

The first page of the document shows these amounts for broad spending categories.\nYou may want to widen the columns and format the numbers before you start:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.1 Check the government’s math with SUM\nOur first job is to make sure the government has provided us data that adds up. To do that, we’ll SUM all of the departments’ spending.\nTo add up the numbers from FY 2020 Actual, enter the following formula in cell C16, just below the number provided by the government:\n  =SUM(C2:C13)\n  and hit the enter key\nCopy that formula to the right. Notice how the formula changes the addresses that it is using as you move to the right – it’s adjusted them to refer to the current column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Change in spending\nThe increase or decrease in projected spending from 2017 to 2018 is just the difference between the two values, beginning in cell F3\n  new-old, or  =E2-D2\nWhen you copy it down, note how the references to each row also adjusted. In line 3, it’s E3-D3, and so on. Excel and other spreadsheets assume that, most of the time, you want these kinds of adjustments to be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Percent change\nWe can’t tell the rate of growth for each department until we calculate the percent change from one year to another. Now that we already have the change, the percent change is easy. The formula is:\n  ( new - old ) / old\n\n  .. or just scream \"NOO\"\nThe new-old is already in column F, so all that’s left is to divide again. In grade school, you also had to move the decimal place over two spots, since the concept of percent change is “out of 100”. Excel formats will do that for you.\nRemember, it’s always (new-old)/old , NOT the big one minus the little one. Doing it correctly, the answer could be negative, meaning the value fell.\n\n\n\nformula\n\n\nWhen you’re done, you can format the answer as a percentage to get it into whole numbers.\nIt’s also worth comparing the picture you get by looking at raw numbers vs. percentages. It’s instructive that federal grants are up 308%.\n\n\n8.2.4 Parts of a whole: percent of total\nWe’d also like to know what portion of the total spending is eaten up by each department. To do that, we need the percent of total.\nIn our case, let’s use the total that the government gave us. In practice, you’d have to decide what to do if your figures didn’t match those provided by officials. You can’t assume that the total is wrong – you could be missing a category, or there could be a mistake in one of the line items.\nThe formula for percent of total is:\n  category / total\nHere’s a good trick with spreadsheets when you need to divide against a fixed total. You don’t have to type in each formula one by one, though. Instead, you’ll use anchors, known in spreadsheets as “absolute references”. Think of a dollar sign as an anchor or stickpin, holding down the location of part of your formula. If you put the stickpin before the letter in the formula, it holds the column in place. If you put it before the number, it holds the row in place. If you put it in both places, it holds the cell in place.\nIn this case, we want to see what percentage property taxes, income taxes, etc. are of the total revenues in FY22, which is $4,331,049,486 (cell E14). Let’s figure it out.\n\nLeft click column F, insert column to the left. Name it Pct of Total\nCreate formula to divide property taxes into total revenues: =(E2/E14)\nModify forumula so it will anchor to the E14 as you move down the spreadsheet =(E2/$E$14)\nCopy formula down to F13"

I am extra paranoid (for good reason) and so I always duplicate a date field before modifying it.

To see all the variations of categorical variables, create a filter and check the different variables\nThis presents a big problem when you are trying to group and summarize based on these variable names. See this chart\nWe see white totals 44 and White, non Hispanic total 3,136. We want those to be together – the total is 3,180 – because they are the same thing. Also note that African Am totals 29 and Black totals 1,645, and we would want to combine those as well.\nLet’s fix it!\nBefore changing any data, let’s work with a copy of the column. - Select race_ethnicity (Column k), left click, copy - Left click on Column K, insert column to right, paste - Rename as race_ethnicity2\nRenaming variables.

You can resolve these differences easily by converting all to Upper or Lower case text using the =UPPER or =LOWER functions.\n\nTo convert NativeAm to lower case, filter on race_ethnicity (Column K) for NativeAm.\nIn race_ethnicity2 (Column L), insert a blank column, and type the function =LOWER(K67) and hit enter.\n\nThe result should be nativeam as the first entry in race_ethnicity2.\nSee this example\n\n\n10.0.4 White space\nOne obnoxious feature of spreadsheet data is the invisible “white space” or hidden character or carriage returns that can impede your ability to group and summarize variables. Look at the age column. See how some numbers are flush left while most are flush right. The flush left data has hidden white space. You can fix this by clicking on individual cells and deleting the space around the number or you can do it with a function.\n\nSelect age (Column H), left click on Column H, insert column to right, rename as age2\nIn cell I2, type =TRIM(H2) and enter.

It can also scale – you can repeat your instructions millions of times, tweak it a little, and re-run the program without messing anything else up. The computer won’t mind. Really.\nWriting code can also be self-documenting. You can largely eliminate those painstaking Excel data diaries and replace them with documents that explain your work as you go. You’ll still need to record information about your interviews and decisions, but you’ll no longer have to write down every mouse click.\nIf you’re nervous about getting started with programming, take look at the Appendix: A gentle introduction to programming and Jesse Lecy’s “Learning how to Learn.”"

Install it second.\nPackages are sets of programs written by volunteers and data scientists that perform specialized jobs more easily that working with the “base” R language. A package must be installed once on your computer, then invoked to use them in a program.\n\n\nFollow this interactive tutorial on installing R, RStudio and the tidyverse on your computer:\nhttps://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/#section-welcome .\n\nThere are two differences between the video and today:\n\nThe tidyverse will take much longer to finish installation. It has a lot to do and often looks like it’s stalled.\nThere are two versions of R for Mac users: The traditional one and the one for the new M1 or M2 chip on the latest machines. Choose the one that matches your machine by checking the apple in the upper left and looking at “About this Mac”. It will say “Apple M1” or “Apple M2” as the processor if you have it."

    "text": "11.2 Unlocking packages and the tidyverse\nThe real power of R comes with packages. Packages are bundles of programs that others have found useful to extend the base R language. R is almost useless without them. There are more than 10,000 packages available for R, each doing a special job.\nIf you followed along with the tutorial, the last thing you did was install a “package” called the tidyverse. Almost everything we do from now on depends on that step.\nThe tidyverse packages up a whole set of other packages that are designed to work together smoothly with similar grammar and syntax. It’s particularly useful for the kind of work reporters do – importing, cleaning and analyzing data that we get from others and can’t control how it’s structured.\nWe’ll be working almost exclusively within the tidyverse in this course. I strongly suggest that when you Google for help, put the word “tidyverse” somewhere in your query. Otherwise, you may get answers that look inscrutable and unfamiliar.\nThe tidyverse is the brainchild of Hadley Wickham, a statistician from New Zealand, who famously identified tidy data principles. He’s currently the chief data scientist for RStudio in Houston."

This setup helps ensure that you always know where to find your work and can move it to another comptuer seamlessly.\nBefore you start, decide on a folder you’ll use to store all of your R work. Within my Documents folder, I created a sub-folder called data-class. It will make this guide a little easier if you do the same thing, especially if you’re not very familiar with using directories and folders.\n\n\n\nStart up RStudio once you’ve made your folder. Make sure you start up RStudio (not the R language) by searching for it in Spotlight or in the Search bar in Windows. Here’s what they look like:\n\nGet to the Preferences (under the RStudio menu item on a Mac) and make sure it looks like this in the General tab:\n\n\n\nsee below\n\n\n\n(I’ve turned OFF all of the options to restore anything when you start up RStudio and set up a default working directory by browsing to the one I just created.)\nUnder the R Markdown options, make sure that the box called “Execute setup chunk automatically” is checked."

    "text": "11.4 The screen\nThis is what your screen probably looks like:\n\n\n\nconsole\n\n\n\nThe Console\nThe Console is where you can type commands and interact directly with the programming language. Think of it as a very powerful calculator at first. One reason to use it is to install packages.\nIf you followed the installation demo, you’ve already used the console to install one package. (Go back and do that part now if you skipped it.) Install a few more that will be useful in this course.\n\nCopy these commands one a a time, and paste them into the Console, then hit Return/Enter to execute the command.\n   install.packages(\"janitor\")\n   install.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\n   install.packages(\"skimr\")\n   install.packages(\"swirl\")\n\nThese package names should all be in quotes. We’ll be installing other packages later in this guide, but for now that is everything you need.\n\n\nFiles tab\nWe won’t be using many of the tabs in the lower right, but the Files tab can help you if you’re having trouble navigating your work. Under the More button, you can choose “Go to working directory”, since that’s where R thinks you’ve parked all of your work. This can be confusing in R, which is why we’ll be working in “projects” that bundle up all of your work in one place.\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe upper right screen is the Environment, which is where your active variables live. A variable is a named thing. It might be a word, a list of words or numbers, or a data frame (spreadsheet). Anything that you want to use has to be listed in that environment before you can reference it. This will make more sense later.\n\n\nTyping into the console\nWhen you type this: 5+5 after the > prompt, you’ll get this back after you press Return/Enter: [1] 10\nWhen you type this: \"Merrill\" (with quotes) after the > prompt, you’ll get this back: [1] \"Merrill\"\nTo create a new variable, you’ll use the assignment operator <- (two characters : A less than sign and a hyphen). Here is how I would create the variable called my_name (lower case, no spaces). Notice how it appears in the Environment after being created. Then I can print it by typing the name of the variable instead of the letters of my name in quotes:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe console remembers your commands, but you have to type them one at a time and it will forget them when you leave for the day. That’s why we’re going to work in programs called R Markdown documents most of the time."

Once you find your data_class folder, then select the Set Working Directory option under the More menu.\nYou can also set the path programmatically using setwd() which means set working directory. Just find the path directory using Finder – directions are here – and copy that link to this command.\n\nsetwd(\"/Users/YOURNAME/Documents/data_class\")"

For individual users, it’s great for making sure that you always have your work.\nGitHub users work in what are known as repositories on their local computers and also push changes to a remote repository located on GitHub. That remote repository is key: if you lose your computer, you can fetch a version of your files from GitHub. If you want to work with someone else on the same files, you can each have a local copy, push changes to GitHub and then pull each others’ changes back to your local computers.\nSo, like Microsoft Word’s track changes but with a remote backup and multiple editors."

    "section": "14.1 Importing data",
    "text": "14.1 Importing data\nThe first thing we need to do is get some data to work with. We do that by reading it in. In our case, we’re going to read a datatable from an “CSV” file, a stripped down version of a spreadsheet you might open in a program like Google Sheets, in which each column is separated by a comma.\nSo step 1 is to import the data. The code to import the data looks like this:\nbaltcity_income<- read_csv(\"assets/data/baltcity_income_clean.csv\") %>% as.data.frame()\nLet’s unpack that.\nThe first part – baltcity_income – is the name of a variable.\nA variable is just a name that we’ll use to refer to some more complex thing. In this case, the more complex thing is the data we’re importing into R that will be stored as a dataframe, which is one way R stores data.\nWe can call this variable whatever we want. The variable name doesn’t matter, technically. We could use any word. Generally we want variable names to be descriptive, hence baltcity_income. It’s good to keep variable names lower case and one word but two or more words need to be connected by an underscore. You can’t start a variable with a number.\nThe <- is the variable assignment operator. It’s how we know we’re assigning something to a word. Think of the arrow as saying “Take everything on the right of this arrow and stuff it into the thing on the left.”\nread_csv() is a function, one that only works when we’ve loaded the tidyverse. A function is a little bit of computer code that takes in information and follows a series of pre-determined steps and spits it back out. A recipe to make pizza is a kind of function. We might call it make_pizza().\nThe function does one thing. It takes a preset collection of ingredients – flour, water, oil, cheese, tomato, salt – and passes them through each step outlined in a recipe, in order. Things like: mix flour and water and oil, knead, let it sit, roll it out, put tomato sauce and cheese on it, bake it in an oven, then take it out.\nThe output of our make pizza() function is a finished pie.\nWe’ll make use of a lot of pre-written functions from the tidyverse and other packages, and even write some of our own. Back to this line of code:\nbaltcity_income<- read_csv(\"assets/data/baltcity_income_clean.csv\") %>% as.data.frame()\nInside of the read_csv() function, we’ve put the name of the file we want to load. Things we put inside of function, to customize what the function does, are called arguments. And lastly, we added a pipe operator %>% (shift + cntl + M) that adds another command to turn the imported data into a data frame with as.data.frame(). The pipe operator - %>% - basically tells R to “and then do this.”\nHere is the entire command in a code chunk. Run it by clicking the green arrow to the right below.\n\n#Set working directory to .../data_journalism_class/04_labs/lab_04/pre_lab_04\n\nbaltcity_income <- read.csv(\"assets/data/baltcity_income_clean.csv\") %>% \n  as.data.frame()\n\nIn this data set, each row represents a Census district, and each column represents a feature of that district: its location, the median household income in 2010, 2016, 2020, the neighborhood identifier and geographic coordinators.\nAfter loading the data, it’s a good idea to get a sense of its shape. What does it look like? There are several ways we can examine it.\nBy looking in the R Studio environment window, we can see the number of rows (called “obs.”, which is short for observations), and the number of columns (called variables). We can double click on the dataframe name in the environment window, and explore it like a spreadsheet.\nThere are several useful functions for getting a sense of the dataset right in our markdown document.\nIf we run glimpse(baltcity_income), it will give us a list of the columns, the data type for each column and and the first few values for each column.\n\nglimpse(baltcity_income)\n\nRows: 200\nColumns: 6\n$ Neighborhood <chr> \"Canton\", \"Patterson Park North & East\", \"Canton\", \"Canto…\n$ x2010        <int> 75938, 58409, 77841, 70313, 86157, 60439, 47131, 59236, 2…\n$ x2016        <int> 100985, 96171, 116875, 97153, 85986, 79063, 64643, 100778…\n$ x2020        <int> 128839, 130357, 151389, 114946, 98194, 95536, 86125, 1018…\n$ Census       <dbl> 101.00, 102.00, 103.00, 104.00, 105.00, 201.00, 202.00, 2…\n$ GEOID        <dbl> 24510010100, 24510010200, 24510010300, 24510010400, 24510…\n\n\nIf we type head(baltcity_income), it will print out the columns and the first six rows of data.\n\nhead(baltcity_income)\n\n                 Neighborhood x2010  x2016  x2020 Census       GEOID\n1                      Canton 75938 100985 128839    101 24510010100\n2 Patterson Park North & East 58409  96171 130357    102 24510010200\n3                      Canton 77841 116875 151389    103 24510010300\n4                      Canton 70313  97153 114946    104 24510010400\n5                 Fells Point 86157  85986  98194    105 24510010500\n6                 Fells Point 60439  79063  95536    201 24510020100\n\n\nWe can also click on the data name in the R Studio environment window to explore it interactively.\n\n14.1.1 Group by and count\nThere is some overlap among the Census tracts, which typically are groups of betweem 1,200 to 8,000 people, and neighborhoods, which can be much larger. Let’s figure out how many neighborhoods are represented in this dataset.\ndplyr has a group by function that compiles things together and then produces simple summaries by counting things, or averaging them together. It’s a good place to start.\nThe first step of every analysis starts with the data being used. Then we apply functions to the data.\nIn our case, the pattern that you’ll use many, many times is: data %>% group_by(COLUMN NAME) %>% summarize(VARIABLE NAME = AGGREGATE FUNCTION(COLUMN NAME))\nIn our dataset, the column with neighborhood identifier is called “Neighborhood.” Neighborhoods overlap with Census tracts.\nHere’s the code to count the number of census tracts in each neighborhood:\n\nbaltcity_income %>%\n  group_by(Neighborhood) %>%\n  summarise(\n    count_tracts = n()\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 56 × 2\n   Neighborhood                      count_tracts\n   <chr>                                    <int>\n 1 Allendale/Irvington/S. Hilton                6\n 2 Beechfield/Ten Hills/West Hills              3\n 3 Belair-Edison                                4\n 4 Brooklyn/Curtis Bay/Hawkins Point            4\n 5 Canton                                       3\n 6 Cedonia/Frankford                            5\n 7 Cherry Hill                                  3\n 8 Chinquapin Park/Belvedere                    2\n 9 Claremont/Armistead                          4\n10 Clifton-Berea                                5\n# ℹ 46 more rows\n\n\nSo let’s walk through that.\nWe start with our dataset – baltcity_incomes – and then we tell it to group the data by a given field in the data. In this case, we wanted to group together all the counties, signified by the field name Neighborhood, which you could get from using the glimpse() function. After we group the data, we need to count them up.\nIn dplyr, we use the summarize() function, which can do alot more than just count things.\nInside the parentheses in summarize, we set up the summaries we want. In this case, we just want a count of the number of loans for each county grouping. The line of code count_tracts = n(), says create a new field, called count_tracts and set it equal to n(). n() is a function that counts the number of rows or records in each group. Why the letter n? The letter n is a common symbol used to denote a count of something.\nWhen we run that, we get a list of counties with a count next to them. But it’s not in any order.\nSo we’ll add another “and then do this” symbol – %>% – and use a new function called arrange(). Arrange does what you think it does – it arranges data in order. By default, it’s in ascending order – smallest to largest. But if we want to know the county with the most loans, we need to sort it in descending order. That looks like this:\n\nbaltcity_income %>%\n  group_by(Neighborhood) %>%\n  summarise(\n    count_tracts = n()\n  ) %>% \n  arrange(desc(count_tracts))\n\n# A tibble: 56 × 2\n   Neighborhood                         count_tracts\n   <chr>                                       <int>\n 1 Southwest Baltimore                             8\n 2 Allendale/Irvington/S. Hilton                   6\n 3 Medfield/Hampden/Woodberry/Remington            6\n 4 Sandtown-Winchester/Harlem Park                 6\n 5 Cedonia/Frankford                               5\n 6 Clifton-Berea                                   5\n 7 Greater Charles Village/Barclay                 5\n 8 Greater Rosemont                                5\n 9 Harford/Echodale                                5\n10 Inner Harbor/Federal Hill                       5\n# ℹ 46 more rows\n\n\nThe Census data contains a column detailing the neighborhood. It has associated the Census tracts to neighborhood names. This dataset may have several neighborhood values since Census tracts are a smaller unit of measurement.\nSouthwest Baltimore neighborhood is spread out over 8 census tracts, more than any other neighborhood.\nHere’s the code to determine the count the number of census tracts in each neighborhood:\n\nbaltcity_income %>%\n   summarise(\n    count_tracts = n()\n  )\n\n  count_tracts\n1          200"

Let’s pull in another dataset and summarize by group.\n\n#loading 2020 and 2010 Baltimore City population by race\nbaltcity_race <- read_csv(\"assets/data/baltcity_race_8_13.csv\") %>% \n  as.data.frame()\n\nNew names:\nRows: 201 Columns: 18\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(2): census_tract, county dbl (16): ...1, geoid, x2010_total, x2010_white,\nx2010_black, x2010_native_a...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -> `...1`\n\n\nLet’s say we wanted to know the total population by white people in Baltimore? For that, we could use the sum() function to add up all of the population in the column “x2020_white”. We put the column we want to total – “amount” – inside the sum() function sum(amount). Note that we can simply add a new summarize function here, keeping our count_loans field in our output table.\nThis abbreviated slice of Census data contains columns detailing the population by race in Census tracts. There is the x2020_total which provides the full population, then x2020_white, x2020_black, x2020_hispanic. We omitted Asians and Pacific islanders and people identifying with more than one race for simplicity in this example.\nHere we can select a race variable and summarize it.\n\nbaltcity_race %>% \n  select(x2020_white, x2020_black) %>% \n  summarize(\n    white_total = sum(x2020_white, na.rm = TRUE),\n    black_total = sum(x2020_black, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n  white_total black_total\n1      178996      375002\n\n\n\n\n14.2.4 Mutate\nOne powerful function in dplyr is the mutate command, which allows us to add together columns, create new columns with averages, percentages, or other calculations. We’ll get into this more next week, but understand that mutate is an important go-to command to transform existing data into something new. It’s very powerful and you will use it a lot.\nHere’s a brief example using the baltcity_race table. We want to construct a ratio of the black population to the white population by Census tract. With mutate, we create a new column called ratio_w_b and then insert the math: the 2020 black population by census tract divided into the 2020 white population. And then we sort in descending order, highest to lowest\n\nrace1 <- baltcity_race %>% \n  select(census_tract, x2020_white, x2020_black) %>% \n  mutate(ratio_w_b = (x2020_black/x2020_white)) %>% \n  arrange(desc(ratio_w_b))\n\nhead(race1)\n\n          census_tract x2020_white x2020_black ratio_w_b\n1    Census Tract 1502           0        2444       Inf\n2    Census Tract 1605           0        3643       Inf\n3 Census Tract 2804.02           1        1264 1264.0000\n4 Census Tract 1608.02          10        3264  326.4000\n5    Census Tract 1607          12        3806  317.1667\n6 Census Tract 1608.01          11        3167  287.9091\n\n\nLook at the new table above: we have a new column – ratio_w_b – that shows the Black to white population ratio. In the next chapter, we will use mutate to kick up your data skils a notch.\nPre-Lab Question:  We know the median income for Baltimore City (I just told you a few paragraphs ago). Construct a filter for all census tracts below the citywide average household income for 2020. Count them. What percentage of the city’s census tracts are below the average? Put that in code too.

    "text": "To do that in R, we can use dplyr and mutate to calculate new metrics in a new field using existing fields of data. That’s the essence of mutate - using the data you have to answer a new question.\nSo first we’ll import the tidyverse so we can work with it.\nWe’ll import a dataset of median household income in Baltimore for the 2010, 2016 and 2020 surveys. The data is in the data folder in this chapter’s pre-lab directory. We’ll use this to explore ways to create new information from existing data.\n\nbaltcity_income <- read_csv(\"assets/data/baltcity_income_clean.csv\") %>% \n  as.data.frame()\n\n#working on this with your laptop, uncomment and use this code below\n#baltcity_income<- read_csv(\"baltcity_income_clean.csv\") %>% \n#  as.data.frame()\n\nOne main question involves how the median income changed from 2010 to 2020. First, let’s add a column called diff_2010_2020 to see how median income changed for each census tract. The code is pretty simple. Remember, with summarize, we used n() to count things. With mutate, we use very similar syntax to calculate a new value – a new column of data – using other values in our dataset.\n\n  baltcity_income %>%\n  select(Census, Neighborhood, x2010, x2020) %>%\n  mutate(Diff_Income = (x2020-x2010)) %>% \n  head()\n\n  Census                Neighborhood x2010  x2020 Diff_Income\n1    101                      Canton 75938 128839       52901\n2    102 Patterson Park North & East 58409 130357       71948\n3    103                      Canton 77841 151389       73548\n4    104                      Canton 70313 114946       44633\n5    105                 Fells Point 86157  98194       12037\n6    201                 Fells Point 60439  95536       35097\n\n\nNow we’ve got our Diff_Income column. Let’s provide some context and use a percentage change calculation to compare the gains. We’ll add a new column, Diff_Pct_2020. Remember the percentage change calculation is (New-Old)/Old\n\nbaltcity_income %>%\n  select(Census, Neighborhood, x2010, x2020) %>%\n    mutate(Diff_Income = (x2020-x2010)) %>% \n    mutate(Diff_Pct_2020 = (x2020-x2010)/x2010) %>% \n    head()\n\n  Census                Neighborhood x2010  x2020 Diff_Income Diff_Pct_2020\n1    101                      Canton 75938 128839       52901     0.6966341\n2    102 Patterson Park North & East 58409 130357       71948     1.2317965\n3    103                      Canton 77841 151389       73548     0.9448491\n4    104                      Canton 70313 114946       44633     0.6347759\n5    105                 Fells Point 86157  98194       12037     0.1397101\n6    201                 Fells Point 60439  95536       35097     0.5807012\n\n\nLook at Diff_Pct_2020. Do those numbers look like we expect them to? No. They’re a decimal expressed as a percentage. So let’s fix that by multiplying by 100. We’re also rounding the result to two digits from nine so it looks cleaner\n\nbaltcity_income %>%\n  select(Census, Neighborhood, x2010, x2020) %>%\n  mutate(Diff_Income = (x2020-x2010)) %>% \n  mutate(Diff_Pct_2020 = round((x2020-x2010)/x2010*100,2)) %>% \n  head()\n\n  Census                Neighborhood x2010  x2020 Diff_Income Diff_Pct_2020\n1    101                      Canton 75938 128839       52901         69.66\n2    102 Patterson Park North & East 58409 130357       71948        123.18\n3    103                      Canton 77841 151389       73548         94.48\n4    104                      Canton 70313 114946       44633         63.48\n5    105                 Fells Point 86157  98194       12037         13.97\n6    201                 Fells Point 60439  95536       35097         58.07\n\n\nNow, let’s fix the ordering with arrange and sort descending on the percentage change column.\n\nbaltcity_income %>%\n  select(Census, Neighborhood, x2010, x2020) %>%\n  mutate(Diff_Income = (x2020-x2010)) %>% \n  mutate(Diff_Pct_2020 = round((x2020-x2010)/x2010*100,2)) %>% \n  arrange(desc(Diff_Pct_2020)) %>% \n  head()\n\n   Census                      Neighborhood x2010  x2020 Diff_Income\n1  402.00               Downtown/Seton Hill 13229  43333       30104\n2  703.00                  Madison/East End 15000  35000       20000\n3  102.00       Patterson Park North & East 58409 130357       71948\n4 2607.00     Orangeville/East Highlandtown 36901  80000       43099\n5 2711.02 North Baltimore/Guilford/Homeland 99300 199531      100231\n6  807.00                   Greenmount East 20679  40885       20206\n  Diff_Pct_2020\n1        227.56\n2        133.33\n3        123.18\n4        116.80\n5        100.94\n6         97.71\n\n\nSo we know who the winners since the descending sort by Diff_Pct_2020 shows us Census tracts by the highest percentage first. Now, which areas suffered the biggest declines in median income? We will copy the previous code and alter the arrange so it is ascending from the lowest value.\n\nbaltcity_income %>%\n  select(Census, Neighborhood, x2010, x2020) %>%\n    mutate(Diff_Income = (x2020-x2010)) %>% \n    mutate(Diff_Pct_2020 = round((x2020-x2010)/x2010*100,2)) %>% \n    arrange(Diff_Pct_2020) %>% \n    head()\n\n   Census                    Neighborhood x2010 x2020 Diff_Income Diff_Pct_2020\n1 1603.00 Sandtown-Winchester/Harlem Park 22292 13963       -8329        -37.36\n2 2804.02               Edmondson Village 52784 41179      -11605        -21.99\n3 2715.03 Greater Roland Park/Poplar Hill 79861 62500      -17361        -21.74\n4 2102.00      Washington Village/Pigtown 46319 36661       -9658        -20.85\n5  805.00                   Clifton-Berea 35223 28203       -7020        -19.93\n6 2716.00           Southern Park Heights 43265 34832       -8433        -19.49\n\n\n\n15.0.1 Using mutate to clean data\nFor this example, we’ll examine a dataset of loans small businesses obtained to stay afloat during the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s called the PPP loan database which stands for Paycheck Protection Program loans.\nTake a look at the city column in our data.\n\n#uncomment below to see the entire dataframe\n#View(maryland_ppp)\n\nYou’ll notice that there’s a mix of styles: “Baltimore” and “BALTIMORE” for example. R will think those are two different cities, and that will mean that any aggregates we create based on city won’t be accurate.\nHow can we fix that? Mutate to the rescue! And a function called str_to_upper that will convert a character column into all uppercase.\n\nmaryland_ppp %>%\n  mutate(\n    upper_city = str_to_upper(city)\n) %>% \n   select(city, upper_city, name, amount) %>% \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  city            upper_city      name                            amount\n  <chr>           <chr>           <chr>                            <dbl>\n1 Columbia        COLUMBIA        BAYWOOD HOTELS INC.            2000000\n2 Lanham          LANHAM          PARTNERS ELECTRIC SERVICE INC. 1086257\n3 Bethesda        BETHESDA        RP3 LLC                         787500\n4 Chevy Chase     CHEVY CHASE     SUSHI KO CHEVY CHASE LLC.       655732\n5 Capitol Heights CAPITOL HEIGHTS VILLAGE ACADEMY OF MARYLAND     469800\n6 Brentwood       BRENTWOOD       GOSHEN HOUSE TRADING LLC        346500\n\n\n\nPro Tip: Notice we kept the original data in city and transformed it in a new column, upper_city. Always a good practice to keep your original data intact in case you make a coding mistake or need to change the original for reference.\n\nWe could do the same thing with the address column in order to standardize that for analysis, too.\nThink of how easy this is compared to a similar data cleaning lesson in Google Sheets.\n\n\n15.0.2 A more powerful use\nMutate is even more useful when combined with some additional functions. Let’s say you want to know if the servicing lender is located in Maryland or outside the state. There are three possible answers:\n\nThe lender is in Maryland\nThe lender is outside Maryland\nThe data doesn’t tell us (servicing_lender_state is blank or NA)\n\nWe can create a new column that accounts for these possibilities and populate it using mutate and case_when, which is like an if/else statement but for more than two options.\n\nmaryland_with_in_out <- maryland_ppp %>%\n  mutate(\n    in_out = case_when(\n        servicing_lender_state == 'NA' ~ \"NA\",\n        servicing_lender_state == 'MD' ~ \"IN\",\n        servicing_lender_state != 'MD' ~ \"OUT\"\n      )\n  ) \n\nmaryland_with_in_out %>% \n  select(name, amount, servicing_lender_state, in_out) %>% \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  name                            amount servicing_lender_state in_out\n  <chr>                            <dbl> <chr>                  <chr> \n1 BAYWOOD HOTELS INC.            2000000 MD                     IN    \n2 PARTNERS ELECTRIC SERVICE INC. 1086257 NY                     OUT   \n3 RP3 LLC                         787500 VA                     OUT   \n4 SUSHI KO CHEVY CHASE LLC.       655732 NY                     OUT   \n5 VILLAGE ACADEMY OF MARYLAND     469800 WV                     OUT   \n6 GOSHEN HOUSE TRADING LLC        346500 NJ                     OUT   \n\n\nWe can then use our new in_out column in group_by statements to make summarizing easier.\nIn this case there are no Maryland loans where servicing_lender_state has a value of ‘NA’, but you should never assume that will be the case for a dataset. If you know that the only options are the lender is in Maryland or is outside it, you can rewrite the previous code as an if/else statement:\n\nmaryland_with_in_out <- maryland_ppp %>%\n  mutate(\n    in_out = if_else(\n        servicing_lender_state == 'MD', \"IN\", \"OUT\"\n      )\n  )\n\nmaryland_with_in_out %>% \n  select(name, amount, servicing_lender_state, in_out) %>% \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  name                            amount servicing_lender_state in_out\n  <chr>                            <dbl> <chr>                  <chr> \n1 BAYWOOD HOTELS INC.            2000000 MD                     IN    \n2 PARTNERS ELECTRIC SERVICE INC. 1086257 NY                     OUT   \n3 RP3 LLC                         787500 VA                     OUT   \n4 SUSHI KO CHEVY CHASE LLC.       655732 NY                     OUT   \n5 VILLAGE ACADEMY OF MARYLAND     469800 WV                     OUT   \n6 GOSHEN HOUSE TRADING LLC        346500 NJ                     OUT   \n\n\nMutate is an essential tool to make your data more useful and allows you to ask more questions.\n\n\n16 Pre-Lab Questions:\nBased on the skills you have learned above, use this dataset of Maryland cities ‘assets/data/city_md_income.csv’ (it is included in your prelab folder)\nAnd answer the following questions:\nQuestion #1:\n\nCalculate the difference in median income from 2010 to 2020 for all places listed. Calculate the percentage change.\n\n\n\n\nWhich city had the highest absolute change? Which had the highest percentage change?\n\n\n\nProduce a table with the top 25 places ranked by the highest percentage change.\n\n\n\nProduce a second table with the top 25 places ranked by the lowest or negative percentage change.\n\n\n\nQuestion #2:  A) Determine the summary statistics of mdcities median income for 2020. Determine the value for the first quartile.\n\nUse mutate and case_when to create a column called “category.” Within this, label cities in the first quartile as “lowest” and the remaining “above”. Create a new table called “lowest” with your results\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #3:  Answer this question in English: Write in Elms\nBuilding on the previous lesson on filtering, describe how you would determine the median value of the percentage change and produce a table with the 10 neighborhoods with the highest change and the 10 with the lowest change."

In the reporting phase, visualizations can:\n\nHelp you identify themes and questions for the rest of your reporting\nIdentify outliers – good stories, or perhaps errors, in your data\nHelp you find typical examples\nShow you holes in your reporting\n\nVisualizations also play multiple roles in publishing:\n\nIllustrate a point made in a story in a more compelling way\nRemove unnecessarily technical information from prose\nAllow exploration, provide transparency about your reporting to readers\n\nVisualizing data is becoming a much greater part of journalism. Large news organizations are creating graphics desks that create complex visuals with data to inform the public about important events. To do it well is a course on its own. And not every story needs a feat of programming and art.\nGood news: one of the best libraries for visualizing data is in the tidyverse and it’s pretty simple to make simple charts quickly with just a little bit of code. It’s called ggplot2.\nLet’s revisit some data we’ve used in the past and turn it into charts. First, let’s load libraries.

    "text": "17.1 Join basics\n“Join” in computer programming mean adding columns to a data frame by combining it with another data frame or table. Reporters use it in many ways, some intended by the people who made the data source, and some not.\nFrom now on, we’ll start using the term “table” instead of “data frame”, since we can talk about several different ones at the same time.\nMany databases are created expecting you to join tables (data frames) because it’s a more efficient way to store and work with large databases. This is what’s called a “relational database”, and they’re everywhere.\nHere’s an example, using campaign finance information. The Federal Elections Commission distributes campaign contribution in related tables, each referring to a different noun. One table lists donations, the other lists candidates and other political action committees. They link together using a common code:\n\n\n\nCampaign finance join\n\n\nThe reason to do this is that you never have to worry that any changes to the candidate information – the treasurer, the address or the office sought – carries over to the donation. It’s only listed once in the candidate table. Most large databases are constructed this way. For example:\n\nYour school records are held using your student ID, which means that your address and home email only needs to be changed once, not in every class or in every account you have with the school.\nInspection records, such as those for restaurants, hospitals, housing code violations and workplace safety, typically have at least three tables: The establishment (like a restaurant or a workplace), an inspection (an event on a date), and a violation (something that they found). They’re linked together using establishment ID’s.\nA court database usually has many types of records: A master case record links to information on charges, defendants, lawyers, sentences and court hearings.\n\nEach table, then, is described using a different noun – candidates or contributions; defendants or cases; students or courses. This conforms to the tidy data principle that different types of information are stored in different tables."

    "section": "17.2 Matchmaking with joins",
    "text": "17.2 Matchmaking with joins\nThe political data type of join described above is often referred to as a “lookup table”. You’ll match codes to their meanings in a way that was intended by the people who made the database. But there are other ways reporters use joins:\n\n“Enterprise” joins\nJournalists have taken to calling a specific kind of join “enterprise”, referring to the enterprising reporters who do this. Here, you’ll look for needles in a haystack. Some of the most famous data journalism investigations relied on joining two databases that started from completely different sources, such as:\n\nBus drivers who had DUI citations\nDonors to a governor who got contracts from the state\nDay care workers with criminal records\nSmall businesses that have defaulted on government backed loans that got a PPP loan anyway.\n\nWhen you match these kinds of datasets, you will always have some error. You always have to report out any suspected matches, so they are time consuming stories.\nIn the mid-2000s, when some politicians insisted that dead people were voting and proposed measures to restrict registration, almost every regional news organization sent reporters on futile hunts for the dead voters. They got lists of people on the voter rolls, then lists of people who had died through the Social Security Death Index or local death certificates. I never met anyone who found a single actual dead voter, but months of reporter-hours were spent tracking down each lead.\nIt’s very common for two people to have the same name in a city. In fact, it’s common to have two people at the same home with the same name – they’ve just left off “Jr.” and “Sr.” in the database. In this case, you’ll find matches that you shouldn’t. These are false positives, or Type I errors in statistics.\nAlso, we rarely get dates of birth or Social Security Numbers in public records, so we have to join by name and sometimes location. If someone has moved, sometimes uses a nickname, or the government has recorded the spelling incorrectly, the join will fail – you’ll miss some of the possible matches. This is very common with company names, which can change with mergers and other changes in management, and can be listed in many different ways.\nThese are false negatives, or Type II errors in statistics.1\nIn different contexts, you’ll want to minimize different kinds of errors. For example, if you are looking for something extremely rare, and you want to examine every possible case – like a child sex offender working in a day care center – you might choose to make a “loose” match and get lots of false positives, which you can check. If you want to limit your reporting only to the most promising leads, you’ll be willing to live with missing some cases in order to be more sure of the joins you find.\nYou’ll see stories of this kind write around the lack of precision – they’ll often say, “we verified x cases of….” rather than pretend that they know of them all.\n\n\nFind cases with interesting characteristics\nYou’ll often want to learn more about a geographic area’s demographics or voting habits or other characteristics, and match it to other data. Sometimes it’s simple: Find the demographics of counties that switched from Trump to Biden as a way to isolate places you might want to visit. Another example from voting might be to find the precinct that has the highest percentage of Latino citizens in the county, then match that precinct against the voter registration rolls to get a list of people you might want to interview on election day. In these instances, the join is used for a filter.\nThis is also common when you have data by zip code or some other geography, and you want to find clusters of interesting potential stories, such as PPP loans in minority neighborhoods.\n\n\nSummarize data against another dataset\nThe previous examples all result in lists of potential story people or places. If you use join on summarized data, you can characterize a broad range of activity across new columns. Simplified, this is how you can write that more PPP money went to predominantly white neighborhoods than those that were majority Black.\n\n\n17.2.1 Types of joins\nThere are several types of joins, each connecting two tables in a slightly different matter. The most important ones are:\n\ninner_join\nleft_join\nanti_join\n\nWe’ll explore how each of these work in example code below:\n\n\n17.2.2 Load libraries\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n\n17.2.3 Load data\nWe’re going to load four tables to demonstrate different types of joins.

The maryland_county_lookup_table is a classic example of a lookup table. It contains the same geoid representing each Maryland county, plus a name column with the proper name.\nWe are going to join maryland_county_population, using the one column both share: geoid. We’ll use an inner_join. The code below says: “Connect the two tables on the geoid column. If a given geoid exists in both tables, include it in our new table. If it isn’t in both, don’t include it.”\n\nupdated_maryland_county_population <- maryland_county_lookup_table %>%\n  inner_join(maryland_county_population, by=\"geoid\")\n\nupdated_maryland_county_population \n\n# A tibble: 24 × 3\n   geoid name                          total_pop\n   <chr> <chr>                             <dbl>\n 1 24001 Allegany County, Maryland         71002\n 2 24003 Anne Arundel County, Maryland    575421\n 3 24005 Baltimore County, Maryland       828193\n 4 24009 Calvert County, Maryland          92094\n 5 24011 Caroline County, Maryland         33260\n 6 24013 Carroll County, Maryland         168233\n 7 24015 Cecil County, Maryland           102889\n 8 24017 Charles County, Maryland         161448\n 9 24019 Dorchester County, Maryland       31994\n10 24021 Frederick County, Maryland       255955\n# ℹ 14 more rows\n\n\nBecause both tables contained the same 24 counties, our new table has 24 counties as well.\n(In this case, they have the same column name, but they don’t have to. As long as they CONTAIN the same thing, they can have different names. You can also join using more than one column).\nWhat happens when they aren’t identical?\nTo illustrate what happens, let’s run the same code, but this time use population table that contains every Maryland county EXCEPT for Prince George’s County. This table only has 23 rows. The lookup table still has 24.\n\n\n# A tibble: 23 × 3\n   geoid name                          total_pop\n   <chr> <chr>                             <dbl>\n 1 24001 Allegany County, Maryland         71002\n 2 24003 Anne Arundel County, Maryland    575421\n 3 24005 Baltimore County, Maryland       828193\n 4 24009 Calvert County, Maryland          92094\n 5 24011 Caroline County, Maryland         33260\n 6 24013 Carroll County, Maryland         168233\n 7 24015 Cecil County, Maryland           102889\n 8 24017 Charles County, Maryland         161448\n 9 24019 Dorchester County, Maryland       31994\n10 24021 Frederick County, Maryland       255955\n# ℹ 13 more rows\n\n\nWhen we join, we get only 23 rows. One table had every Maryland county. The other had every county but Prince George’s. When we inner join, only values that both tables have in common are returned. Thus, we get a table without P.G.\nThis gif from https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain shows what happens with inner_joins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.2.5 Left Joins\nLet’s stick with our mismatched tables to illustrate what happens with another type of join, a left join (and it’s cousin, the right join). The code is the same, but we’ve swapped left_join for inner_join. Remember, our population table is missing P.G. county, but the lookup table has it.\n\nupdated_maryland_county_population_no_pg <- maryland_county_lookup_table %>%\n  left_join(maryland_county_population_no_pg, by=\"geoid\")\n\nupdated_maryland_county_population_no_pg\n\n# A tibble: 24 × 3\n   geoid name                          total_pop\n   <chr> <chr>                             <dbl>\n 1 24001 Allegany County, Maryland         71002\n 2 24003 Anne Arundel County, Maryland    575421\n 3 24005 Baltimore County, Maryland       828193\n 4 24009 Calvert County, Maryland          92094\n 5 24011 Caroline County, Maryland         33260\n 6 24013 Carroll County, Maryland         168233\n 7 24015 Cecil County, Maryland           102889\n 8 24017 Charles County, Maryland         161448\n 9 24019 Dorchester County, Maryland       31994\n10 24021 Frederick County, Maryland       255955\n# ℹ 14 more rows\n\n\nWhat happens? Everywhere there’s a match on GEOID, the population value is returned.\nBut look closely at Prince George’s County. Its value is NA.\nA left_join says “Return every single value from our first table – in this case the lookup table, with 24 rows. Where there’s a match with the population table, make the match. If there is no match, just put NA.”\nUnlike the inner_join, the left_join returned P.G. county despite it’s lack of a match.\nThis gif from https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain shows what happens with left_joins.\n\n\n\n\n\nA note: left_join has a close cousin called the right_join which isn’t used very often, and we won’t delve into here. It’s basically the same thing, it just starts from the second table, not the first."

    "text": "17.4 Joining risks\nThere are lots of risks in joining tables that you created yourself, or that were created outside a big relational database system. Keep an eye on the number of rows returned every time that you join – you should know what to expect.\n\n17.4.1 Double counting with joins\nWe won’t go into this in depth, but just be aware it’s easy to double-count rows when you join. Here’s a made-up example, in which a zip code is on the border and is in two counties:\nSay you want to use some data on zip codes :\n\n\n\nzip code\ncounty\ninfo\n\n\n\n\n21012\nPG\nsome data\n\n\n21012\nBaltimore\nsome more data\n\n\n\nand match it to a list of restaurants in a zip code:\n\n\n\nzip code\nrestaurant name\n\n\n\n\n21012\nMy favorite restaurant\n\n\n21012\nMy second-favorite restaurant\n\n\n\nWhen you match these on zip code, you’ll get 4 rows:\n\n\n\nzip code\ncounty\ninfo\nrestaurant name\n\n\n\n\n21012\nPG\nsome data\nMy favorite restaurant\n\n\n21012\nBaltimore\nsome more data\nMy favorite restaurant\n\n\n21012\nPG\nsome data\nMy second-favorite restaurant\n\n\n21012\nBaltimore\nsome more data\nMy second-favority restaurant\n\n\n\nNow, every time you try to count restaurants, these two will be double-counted.\nIn computing, this is called a “many-to-many” relationship – there are many rows of zip codes and many rows of restaurants. In journalism, we call it spaghetti. It’s usually an unintended mess.\nHere’s a gif that shows the double counting in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.4.2 Losing rows with joins\nThe opposite can occur if you aren’t careful and there are items you want to keep that are missing in your reference table. That’s what happened in the immunization data above for the seven schools that I couldn’t find.\n\n\n17.4.3 Merging or Binding\nJoins are one way to combine two data sets, using shared values in one or more columns. Binding two data sets together is another way.\nLet’s suppose we have two tables with population information for Maryland counties, each with the same columns: geoid, name and total population.\n\nOne has information for Maryland’s 10 largest counties by population\nThe other has information for every other Maryland county.\n\n\n###\n# Total population for each top-10 largest Maryland county \n# County identified by GEOID (a 5-digit code) and name\n###\n\nmaryland_large_county_population <- read_rds(\"assets/data/maryland_large_county_population.rds\")\n\n\n###\n# Total population for all other Maryland counties\n# County identified by GEOID (a 5-digit code) and name\n###\nmaryland_small_county_population <- read_rds(\"assets/data/maryland_small_county_population.rds\")\n\n\n# Display\nmaryland_large_county_population\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   geoid name                             total_pop\n   <chr> <chr>                                <dbl>\n 1 24031 Montgomery County, Maryland        1047661\n 2 24033 Prince George's County, Maryland    910551\n 3 24005 Baltimore County, Maryland          828193\n 4 24510 Baltimore city, Maryland            602274\n 5 24003 Anne Arundel County, Maryland       575421\n 6 24027 Howard County, Maryland             322407\n 7 24021 Frederick County, Maryland          255955\n 8 24025 Harford County, Maryland            253736\n 9 24013 Carroll County, Maryland            168233\n10 24017 Charles County, Maryland            161448\n\nmaryland_small_county_population\n\n# A tibble: 14 × 3\n   geoid name                          total_pop\n   <chr> <chr>                             <dbl>\n 1 24029 Kent County, Maryland             19456\n 2 24039 Somerset County, Maryland         25699\n 3 24023 Garrett County, Maryland          29155\n 4 24019 Dorchester County, Maryland       31994\n 5 24011 Caroline County, Maryland         33260\n 6 24041 Talbot County, Maryland           37087\n 7 24035 Queen Anne's County, Maryland     50163\n 8 24047 Worcester County, Maryland        51967\n 9 24001 Allegany County, Maryland         71002\n10 24009 Calvert County, Maryland          92094\n11 24015 Cecil County, Maryland           102889\n12 24045 Wicomico County, Maryland        103222\n13 24037 St. Mary's County, Maryland      113182\n14 24043 Washington County, Maryland      150575\n\n\nIf we want to combine these tables into one dataset with every county’s information, a join isn’t the way to go. For that, we’d use bind_rows(). Thick of bind_rows as stacking two tables on top of each other.

Let’s update the dataframe by mutating that column to change the data type to numeric.\n\nstate_population_dirty <- state_population_dirty %>%\n  mutate(total_pop = as.numeric(total_pop))\n\nglimpse(state_population_dirty)\n\nRows: 255\nColumns: 11\n$ geoid                        <chr> \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"01\", \"02\", \"02\",…\n$ state                        <chr> \"Alabama\", \"Alabama\", \"Alabama\", \"Alabama…\n$ year                         <dbl> 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2015, 2016,…\n$ total_pop                    <dbl> 4830620, 4841164, 4850771, 4864680, 48931…\n$ white_alone_pop              <dbl> 3325464, 3325037, 3317702, 3317453, 33028…\n$ black_alone_pop              <dbl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 25022, 24443, 23702, …\n$ amer_ind_ak_native_alone_pop <dbl> 23850, 23919, 25098, 25576, 24764, 101313…\n$ asian_alone_pop              <dbl> 59599, 60744, 62815, 64609, 67909, 42921,…\n$ native_hi_alone_pop          <dbl> 2439, 2008, 2213, 2182, 2042, 8841, 8862,…\n$ other_race_alone_pop         <dbl> 61078, 61991, 66942, 70055, 74996, 9273, …\n$ two_or_more_races_pop        <dbl> 81646, 85412, 88834, 91619, 119322, 61755…\n\n\nNow when we sort, it works.\n\nstate_population_dirty %>%\n  filter(year == 2020) %>%\n  arrange(desc(total_pop))\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 11\n   geoid state           year total_pop white_alone_pop black_alone_pop\n   <chr> <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>           <dbl>           <dbl>\n 1 06    California      2020  39346023        22053721         2250962\n 2 48    Texas           2020  28635442        19805623         3464424\n 3 12    Florida         2020  21216924        15199588         3381061\n 4 36    New York        2020  19514849        12160045         3002401\n 5 42    Pennsylvania    2020  12794885        10155004         1419582\n 6 17    Illinois        2020  12716164         8874067         1796660\n 7 39    Ohio            2020  11675275         9394878         1442655\n 8 13    Georgia         2020  10516579         6020265         3319844\n 9 37    North Carolina  2020  10386227         7019443         2217522\n10 26    Michigan        2020   9973907         7735902         1360149\n# ℹ 41 more rows\n# ℹ 5 more variables: amer_ind_ak_native_alone_pop <dbl>,\n#   asian_alone_pop <dbl>, native_hi_alone_pop <dbl>,\n#   other_race_alone_pop <dbl>, two_or_more_races_pop <dbl>"

Because of that value, the summarise calculation won’t work. We could tell R to ignore NA values when doing the calculation, by adding na.rm=TRUE to the sum function.\n\nstate_population_dirty %>%\n  filter(year == 2020) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total_us_black_alone_population = sum(black_alone_pop, na.rm=TRUE)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  total_us_black_alone_population\n                            <dbl>\n1                        39926065\n\n\nBut! That’s not the right answer. We want to know the total for the U.S. including Alabama in 2020. So, we need to fix that value. We look up the value on the Census website, and determine it’s 1,301,319 for 2020. So let’s update the column. This uses a function called case_when() with mutate().\nHere’s how to interpret what the function below says.\n“Overwrite the black_alone_pop column with new values in one of the rows, and the old values for every other row. If the state column equals Alabama AND (the &) the year column equals 2020 THEN (the tilde or ~) put the value 1301319. In any other case (any other state, or Alabama in any other year than 2020), THEN keep the value that currently exists in the black_alone_pop column.\n\nstate_population_dirty <- state_population_dirty %>%\n  mutate(black_alone_pop = case_when(\n    state == \"Alabama\" & year == 2020 ~ 1301319,\n    TRUE ~ black_alone_pop\n  ))\n\nstate_population_dirty\n\n# A tibble: 255 × 11\n   geoid state    year total_pop white_alone_pop black_alone_pop\n   <chr> <chr>   <dbl>     <dbl>           <dbl>           <dbl>\n 1 01    Alabama  2015   4830620         3325464              NA\n 2 01    Alabama  2016   4841164         3325037              NA\n 3 01    Alabama  2017   4850771         3317702              NA\n 4 01    Alabama  2018   4864680         3317453              NA\n 5 01    Alabama  2020   4893186         3302834         1301319\n 6 02    Alaska   2015    733375          484250           25022\n 7 02    Alaska   2016    736855          483518           24443\n 8 02    Alaska   2017    738565          481971           23702\n 9 02    Alaska   2018    738516          478834           24129\n10 02    Alaska   2020    736990          466961           23894\n# ℹ 245 more rows\n# ℹ 5 more variables: amer_ind_ak_native_alone_pop <dbl>,\n#   asian_alone_pop <dbl>, native_hi_alone_pop <dbl>,\n#   other_race_alone_pop <dbl>, two_or_more_races_pop <dbl>\n\n\nNow when we run our summarization code, it works.\n\nstate_population_dirty %>%\n  filter(year == 2020) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total_us_black_alone_population = sum(black_alone_pop)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  total_us_black_alone_population\n                            <dbl>\n1                        41227384"

But it does not.\nFortunately, there’s still a way we join them, using a special kind of join that only works with geographic data – a spatial join.\nFirst, let’s load a spatial dataframe of Census tracts with income information attached.\n\npg_tract_income <- read_rds(\"assets/data/pg_tract_income.rds\")\n\npg_tract_income\n\nSimple feature collection with 214 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -77.08627 ymin: 38.53537 xmax: -76.66952 ymax: 39.13129\nGeodetic CRS:  NAD83\nFirst 10 features:\n         geoid                                                   name\n1  24033802804 Census Tract 8028.04, Prince George's County, Maryland\n2  24033801701 Census Tract 8017.01, Prince George's County, Maryland\n3  24033801308 Census Tract 8013.08, Prince George's County, Maryland\n4  24033805601 Census Tract 8056.01, Prince George's County, Maryland\n5  24033800102 Census Tract 8001.02, Prince George's County, Maryland\n6  24033801411 Census Tract 8014.11, Prince George's County, Maryland\n7  24033802002 Census Tract 8020.02, Prince George's County, Maryland\n8  24033803527 Census Tract 8035.27, Prince George's County, Maryland\n9  24033800413 Census Tract 8004.13, Prince George's County, Maryland\n10 24033805802 Census Tract 8058.02, Prince George's County, Maryland\n   median_household_income                       geometry\n1                    56368 MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.89815 3...\n2                    71250 MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.95858 3...\n3                   129020 MULTIPOLYGON (((-77.01587 3...\n4                    57188 MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.99068 3...\n5                    77652 MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.86649 3...\n6                   106806 MULTIPOLYGON (((-77.0172 38...\n7                    91758 MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.93032 3...\n8                   102292 MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.832 38....\n9                    79821 MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.83767 3...\n10                   81172 MULTIPOLYGON (((-76.97962 3...\n\n\nLet’s visualize it.

We’ll create a column called attendance_bucket that classifies each school into one of two buckets – high attendance (top half) and low attendance (bottom half). We then group by that new attendance bucket and calculate the average income in each of those groups.\n\nincome_to_attendance %>%\n  mutate(attendance_bucket = ntile(attend_rate_pct,2)) %>%\n  mutate(attendance_bucket = case_when(\n    attendance_bucket == 1 ~ \"low_attendance\",\n    attendance_bucket == 2 ~ \"high_attendance\"\n  )) %>%\n  group_by(attendance_bucket) %>%\n  summarise(\n    median_household_income = mean(median_household_income)\n  )\n\nSimple feature collection with 2 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -77.01563 ymin: 38.66074 xmax: -76.71038 ymax: 39.10973\nGeodetic CRS:  NAD83\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  attendance_bucket median_household_income                             geometry\n  <chr>                               <dbl>                     <MULTIPOINT [°]>\n1 high_attendance                   105587.

Schools with high attendance are located in Census tracts that have, on average, an income of $105,587. Schools with low attendance are located in Census tracts that have, on average, income of $80,261.\nQuestion #1:  Answer this question in English: Write in Elms\nDevelop two questions that you could answer with a spatial join as described in this chapter, outside of the domain of education.

The code below says: create a new object called schools_homicides by attempting to connect each point in our schools table with each point in our homicides table. If there’s an overlap, return that match to our new table.\n\nschools_homicides <- washington_schools %>%\n  st_join(washington_homicides, left=\"FALSE\")\n\nschools_homicides\n\nSimple feature collection with 0 features and 15 fields\nBounding box:  xmin: NA ymin: NA xmax: NA ymax: NA\nGeodetic CRS:  NAD83\n# A tibble: 0 × 16\n# ℹ 16 variables: school_name <chr>, address <chr>, city.x <chr>,\n#   state.x <chr>, zip <chr>, geometry <GEOMETRY [°]>, uid <chr>,\n#   reported_date <dbl>, victim_last <chr>, victim_first <chr>,\n#   victim_race <chr>, victim_age <chr>, victim_sex <chr>, city.y <chr>,\n#   state.y <chr>, disposition <chr>\n\n\nNotice that it returned zero rows. That’s because for there to be a match, a school point had to be essentially on top of a shooting point. The points are very small, and it’s unlikely there will be an exact match in our data.\nWe can fix that by making the size of the point bigger, by converting it to a polygon. How do we define “near” for the purpose of our question? Let’s use “within 100 meters” of the centerpoint of the school as our definition.\nWe’re going to use a new function st_buffer to create a “buffer” around our latitude longitude point. We’re going to change our geometry from a small point to a circle with a radius of 100 meters centered on that point.\n\nwashington_schools_buffered <- washington_schools %>%\n  mutate(geometry = st_buffer(geometry, dist=100))\n\nwashington_schools_buffered\n\nSimple feature collection with 239 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -77.10182 ymin: 38.82285 xmax: -76.91885 ymax: 38.98553\nGeodetic CRS:  NAD83\n# A tibble: 239 × 6\n   school_name               address city  state zip                    geometry\n * <chr>                     <chr>   <chr> <chr> <chr>             <POLYGON [°]>\n 1 Cesar Chavez PCS for Pub… 3701 H… Wash… DC    20019 ((-76.94809 38.90084, -7…\n 2 Cesar Chavez Public Char… 3701 H… Wash… DC    20019 ((-76.94809 38.90084, -7…\n 3 Friendship PCS - Collegi… 4095 M… Wash… DC    20019 ((-76.94558 38.89821, -7…\n 4 Friendship PCS - Southea… 645 MI… Wash… DC    20032 ((-76.99599 38.84797, -7…\n 5 Friendship PCS - Technol… 2705 M… Wash… DC    20032 ((-76.99592 38.84915, -7…\n 6 Friendship PCS - Blow Pi… 725 19… Wash… DC    20002 ((-76.97583 38.89864, -7…\n 7 Friendship PCS - Blow Pi… 725 19… Wash… DC    20002 ((-76.97583 38.89864, -7…\n 8 Friendship PCS - Chamber… 1345 P… Wash… DC    20003 ((-76.9878 38.87966, -76…\n 9 Friendship PCS - Woodrid… 2959 C… Wash… DC    20018 ((-76.96495 38.92914, -7…\n10 Friendship PCS - Woodrid… 2959 C… Wash… DC    20018 ((-76.96495 38.92914, -7…\n# ℹ 229 more rows\n\n\nLet’s visualize it.

    "text": "When we’ve brought data in R to analyze up to this point, we’ve mostly been working with CSVs stored on our local computers or read them off the internet.\nBut there are many, many ways to bring data into R. Today we’re going to learn a new method that will allow us to pull data stored in a third-party database using a thing called an API or application programming interface. API means different things in different contexts, but in this case it means “a way to get data we want stored in a third-party database, in specific ways that third-party allows.”\nTwitter’s API lets us pull in a user’s tweets for text analysis.\nSpotify lets us ingest a bunch of information about what people are listening to.\nYou can access data available through pretty much any API, or application programming interface, by sending a “query” and getting back a response, using the excellent HTTR package. That process is a bit complicated for this introduction.\nFortunately, users in the R communities have developed dozens of packages that allow us to pull data from APIs without learning a bunch of complex new programming concepts. These packages hide all the messy bits of connecting to an API inside of handy functions that are easier to use.\nHere are some great examples:\nTidycensus: for loading and working with all manner of U.S. Census Data. This is what we’ll work with today. RTweet: want to analyze all of Trump’s tweets (before he got banned) this will help you. SpotifyR: want to know what key most Taylor Swift songs are in? This can help you. cfbfastR: want to analyze play-by-play data for your favorite college football team? Look no further. wehoop: want to know more about your favorite WNBA team? Here you go. sportsdataverse: is a collection of API wrappers for a dozen sports leagues, including hockey, soccer, baseball and even chess. ARCOS: want to know where the most opioids were shipped by drug companies over the last decade. This API from the Post will help. gmailr Feel like ingesting your email inbox into R and analyzing it? Or sending emails from R Studio? This will help.\nWe’ll be working with U.S. Census data today, and the tidycensus package."

    "section": "21.2 Using Tidycensus",
    "text": "21.2 Using Tidycensus\nThere is truly an astonishing amount of data collected by the US Census Bureau. First, there’s the Census that most people know – the every 10 year census. That’s the one mandated by the Constitution where the government attempts to count every person in the US. It’s a mind-boggling feat to even try, and billions get spent on it. That data is used first for determining how many representatives each state gets in Congress. From there, the Census gets used to divide up billions of dollars of federal spending.\nTo answer the questions the government needs to do that, a ton of data gets collected. That, unfortunately, means the Census is exceedingly complicated to work with.\nThe good news is, the Census has an API – an application programming interface. What that means is we can get data directly through the Census Bureau’s database via calls over the internet.\nLet’s demonstrate.\nWe’re going to use a library called tidycensus which makes calls to the Census API in a very tidy way, and gives you back tidy data. That means we don’t have to go through the process of importing the data from a file.\nI can’t tell you how amazing this is, speaking from experience. The documentation for this library is here.\nFirst we need to install tidycensus using the console: install.packages(\"tidycensus\")\nNow load both the tidyverse and tidycensus and janitor.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n\n\nTo use the API, you need an API key. An API key is just a password. You’ll run a function to get data from the Census, essentially knocking on the agency’s data door. Before it will let you know, it will ask for your password.\nSome APIs are open for access without a password. But most are like the Census, which require you to have some sort of authentication key.\nTo get that for the Census, you need to apply for an API key with the Census Bureau. It takes a few minutes and you need to activate your key via email. Once you have your key, you need to set that for this session. Just FYI: Your key is your key. Do not share it around.\nIn the code block below, replace YOUR KEY HERE with your key you get by email. It’s a long string of letters and numbers, like this: 549950d36c22ff16455fe196bbbd01d63cf. Don’t use this one. It won’t work. Use your own.\n\ncensus_api_key(\"549950d36c22ff16455fe196bbbd01d63cfbe6cf\", install=TRUE, overwrite = TRUE)\n\nYour original .Renviron will be backed up and stored in your R HOME directory if needed.\n\n\nYour API key has been stored in your .Renviron and can be accessed by Sys.getenv(\"CENSUS_API_KEY\"). \nTo use now, restart R or run `readRenviron(\"~/.Renviron\")`\n\n\n[1] \"549950d36c22ff16455fe196bbbd01d63cfbe6cf\"\n\n\nThe two main functions in tidycensus are get_decennial, which retrieves data from the 2000 and 2010 Censuses (and soon the 2020 Census), and get_acs, which pulls data from the American Community Survey, a between-Censuses annual survey that provides estimates, not hard counts, but asks more detailed questions.\nIf you’re new to Census data, there’s a very good set of slides from Kyle Walker, the creator of tidycensus, and he’s working on a book that you can read for free online.\nIt’s important to keep in mind that Census data represents people - you, your neighbors and total strangers. It also requires some level of definitions, especially about race & ethnicity, that may or may not match how you define yourself or how others define themselves.\nSo to give you some idea of how complicated the data is, let’s pull up just one file from the decennial Census. We’ll use a file called “pl”, which is short for “public law”, which is named that for reasons too boring to delve into here. It represents the first set of data released from the 2020 Census, and it only contains basics about total population counts, counts by race, and housing information.\nThis function load_variables returns a dataframe of all of the different variables available in the pl dataset. This table has three columns.\n\nname: a unique code for a given variable.\nlabel: a description of what that variable describes.\nconcept: a larger category that the label sits under.\n\n\npl_2020 <- load_variables(2020, \"pl\", cache = TRUE)\n\npl_2020\n\n# A tibble: 301 × 3\n   name    label                                                         concept\n   <chr>   <chr>                                                         <chr>  \n 1 H1_001N \" !!Total:\"                                                   OCCUPA…\n 2 H1_002N \" !!Total:!!Occupied\"                                         OCCUPA…\n 3 H1_003N \" !!Total:!!Vacant\"                                           OCCUPA…\n 4 P1_001N \" !!Total:\"                                                   RACE   \n 5 P1_002N \" !!Total:!!Population of one race:\"                          RACE   \n 6 P1_003N \" !!Total:!!Population of one race:!!White alone\"             RACE   \n 7 P1_004N \" !!Total:!!Population of one race:!!Black or African Americ… RACE   \n 8 P1_005N \" !!Total:!!Population of one race:!!American Indian and Ala… RACE   \n 9 P1_006N \" !!Total:!!Population of one race:!!Asian alone\"             RACE   \n10 P1_007N \" !!Total:!!Population of one race:!!Native Hawaiian and Oth… RACE   \n# ℹ 291 more rows\n\n\nFor example: P1_001N (row 4) represents the total population.

    "text": "21.3 The ACS\nBetween the decennial censuses, the bureau releases results from the American Community Survey on a yearly schedule. It asks much more detailed questions than the decennial census.\nThe bad news is that it’s more complicated because it’s more like survey data with a large sample. That means there’s margins of error and confidence intervals to worry about.\nBy default, using get_acs fetches data from the 5-year average estimates (currently 2016-2021), but you can specify 1-year estimates for jurisdictions with at least 65,000 people (many counties and cities).\nHere’s an example using the 5-year ACS estimates. Let’s ask: what is Maryland’s richest county?\nOne way we can measure this is by median household income. That variable is B19013_001, so we can get that data like this:\n\nmd <- get_acs(geography = \"county\",\n              variables = c(median_income = \"B19013_001\"),\n              state = \"MD\",\n              year = 2020) %>%\n  arrange(desc(estimate))\n\nGetting data from the 2016-2020 5-year ACS\n\nmd\n\n# A tibble: 24 × 5\n   GEOID NAME                          variable      estimate   moe\n   <chr> <chr>                         <chr>            <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 24027 Howard County, Maryland       median_income   124042  3448\n 2 24009 Calvert County, Maryland      median_income   112696  3287\n 3 24031 Montgomery County, Maryland   median_income   111812  1361\n 4 24017 Charles County, Maryland      median_income   103678  1654\n 5 24003 Anne Arundel County, Maryland median_income   103225  1817\n 6 24021 Frederick County, Maryland    median_income   100685  1927\n 7 24013 Carroll County, Maryland      median_income    99569  3051\n 8 24035 Queen Anne's County, Maryland median_income    96467  4785\n 9 24037 St. Mary's County, Maryland   median_income    95864  3872\n10 24025 Harford County, Maryland      median_income    94003  2398\n# ℹ 14 more rows\n\n\nHoward, Calvert, Montgomery, Anne Arundel, Charles. What do they all have in common? Lots of suburban flight from DC and Baltimore.\nBut do the margins of error – moe – let us say one county is richer than the other?\nWe can find this out visually using error bars. Don’t worry much about the code here – we’ll cover that in a later lab.\n\nmd %>%\n  mutate(NAME = gsub(\" County, Maryland\", \"\", NAME)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = reorder(NAME, estimate))) +\n  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = estimate - moe, xmax = estimate + moe)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Household income by county in Maryland\",\n       subtitle = \"2015-2019 American Community Survey\",\n       y = \"\",\n       x = \"ACS estimate (bars represent margin of error)\")\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, some of the error bars are quite wide. Some are narrow. But if the bars overlap, it means the difference between the two counties is within the margin of error, and the differences aren’t statistically significant. So is the difference between Calvert and Montgomery significant? Nope. Is the difference between Howard and everyone else significant? Yes it is.\nQuestion #1: \nRun this code to load a table of variables available in the American Community Survey.\n\nacs_variable <- load_variables(dataset = \"acs5\", year=2020)\n\nWrite code to answer this question, from the American Community Survey.\nWhich US state has the largest male population.\nWhat is the state and what is the percentage? Post the state, the population AND the code you wrote to produce it on ELMS. Use the American Community Survey for this."

    "text": "Why? Because they have a website. That’s it. That’s their reason. They say they don’t have to give you the data because they’ve already given you the data, never mind that they haven’t given to you in a form you can actually load into R with ease.\nLucky for us, there’s a way for us to write code to get data even when an agency hasn’t made it easy: webscraping.\nOne of the most powerful tools you can learn as a data journalist is how to scrape data from the web. Scraping is the process of programming a computer to act like a human that opens a web browser, goes to a website, ingests the HTML from that website into R and turns it into data.\nThe degree of difficulty here goes from “Easy” to “So Hard You Want To Throw Your Laptop Out A Window.” And the curve between the two can be steep. You can learn how to scrape “Easy” in a day. The hard ones take a little more time, but it’s often well worth the effort because it lets you get stories you couldn’t get without it.\nIn this chapter, we’ll show you an easy one. And in the next chapter, we’ll so you a moderately harder one.\nLet’s start easy.\nWe’re going to use a library called rvest, which you can install it the same way we’ve done all installs: go to the console and install.packages(\"rvest\").\nLike so many R package names, rvest is a bad pun. You’re supposed to read it to sound like “harvest”, as in “harvesting” information from a website the same way you’d harvest crops in a field.\nWe’ll load these packages first:\n\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nFor this example, we’re going to work on loading a simple table of data from the Maryland State Board of Elections. This is a table of unofficial election results from the July Republican gubernatorial primary election.\nLet’s suppose we can’t find a table like that for download, but we do see a version on the SBOE website at this URL: https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2022/primary_results/gen_detail_results_2022_1_1_Republican.html.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could get this table into R with the following manual steps: highlighting the text, copying it into Excel, saving it as a csv, and reading it into R.\nOr, we could write a few lines of webscraping code to have R do that for us!\nIn this simple example, it’s probably faster to do it manually than have R do it for us. And this table is unlikely to change much in the future. But we’re going to\nWhy would we ever write code to grab a single table? There’s several reasons:\n\nOur methods are transparent. If a colleague wants to run our code from scratch to factcheck our work, they don’t need to repeat the manual steps, which are harder to document than writing code.\nLet’s suppose we wanted to grab the same table every day, to monitor for changes (like, say, a table on a health department website that has COVID case numbers that update every day). Writing a script once, and pressing a single button every day is going to be much more efficient than doing this manually every day.\nIf we’re doing it manually, we’re more likely to make a mistake, like maybe failing to copy every row from the whole table.\nIt’s good practice to prepare us to do more complex scraping jobs. As we’ll see in the next chapter, if we ever want to grab the same table from hundreds of pages, writing code is much faster and easier than going to a hundred different pages ourselves and downloading data.\n\nSo, to scrape, the first thing we need to do is start with the URL. Let’s store it as an object called sboe_url.\n\nsboe_url <- \"https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2022/primary_results/gen_detail_results_2022_1_1_Republican.html\"\n\nWhen we go to the web page, we can see a nicely-designed page that contains our information.\nBut what we really care about, for our purposes, is the html code that creates that page.\nIn our web browser, if we right-click anywhere on the page and select “view source” from the popup menu, we can see the source code. Or you can just copy this into Google Chrome: view-source:https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2022/primary_results/gen_detail_results_2022_1_1_Republican.html.\nHere’s a picture of what some of the source code looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll use those HTML tags – things like <table> and <tr> – to grab the info we need.\nOkay, step 1.\nLet’s write a bit of code to tell R to go to the URL for the page and ingest all of that HTML code. In the code below, we’re starting with our URL and using the read_html() function from rvest to ingest all of the page html, storing it as an object called naics_industry.\n\n# read in the html\nresults <- sboe_url %>%\n  read_html()\n\n# display the html below\nresults\n\n{html_document}\n<html lang=\"en\" manifest=\"manifest.appcache\">\n[1] <head>\\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...\n[2] <body>\\r\\n    <div class=\"container\">  \\r\\n        <div class=\"skipNav\">\\ ...\n\n\nIf you’re running this code in R Studio, in our environment window at right, you’ll see results as a “list of 2”.\nThis is not a dataframe, it’s a different type of data structure a “nested list.”\nIf we click on the name “results” in our environment window, we can see that it’s pulled in the html and shown us the general page structure. Nested within the <html> tag is the <head> and <body>, the two fundamental sections of most web pages. We’re going to pull information out of the <body> tag in a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, our task is to just pull out the section of the html that contains the information we need.\nBut which part do we need from that mess of html code? To figure that out, we can go back to the page in a web browser like chrome, and use built in developer tools to “inspect” the html code underlying the page.\nOn the page, find the table we want to grab and right click on the word “jurisdiction” in the column header of the table. That will bring up a dropdown menu. Select “Inspect”, which will pop up a window called the “element inspector” that shows us where different elements on the page are located, what html tags created those elements, and other info.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire table that we want of results is actually contained inside an html <table>. It has a <tbody> that contains one row <tr> per county.\nBecause it’s inside of a table, and not some other kind of element (like a <div>), rvest has a special function for easily extracting and converting html tables, called html_table().

First we’ll use clean_names() to lower the column names. Then use rename() to replace the candidate column names with simpler versions. We can just use the column positions instead of writing out the full names, which is nice.\nThen let’s use slice() to remove the last row – row number 25 – which contains totals and percentages that we don’t need.\nFinally, we’ll make sure the vote tallies are numbers using mutate and gsub(), which we use to replace all the commas with nothing.\n\n# Read in all html from table, get the HTML table.\nresults <- sboe_url %>%\n  read_html() %>%\n  html_table()\n\n# Standardize column headers with rename() \n# remove last row with slice()\n# apply parse_number to columns 2,3,4 and 5.\n\nresults <- results[[1]] %>%\n  clean_names() %>%\n  rename(cox = 2, ficker = 3, schulz = 4, werner = 5) %>%\n  slice(-25) %>%\n  mutate(across(c(2:5), parse_number))\n\n\n\n# show the dataframe\nresults\n\n# A tibble: 24 × 5\n   jurisdiction       cox ficker schulz werner\n   <chr>            <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 Allegany          4469    399   2259     99\n 2 Anne Arundel     18039    711  18581    513\n 3 Baltimore City    1771    168   2010    156\n 4 Baltimore County 18129    842  18247    649\n 5 Calvert           6081    335   3628    186\n 6 Caroline          2533     49   1409     39\n 7 Carroll          10462    404   9997    268\n 8 Cecil             4998    203   3487    128\n 9 Charles           3473    176   1709    127\n10 Dorchester        2475     75    916     42\n# ℹ 14 more rows\n\n\nAnd there we go. We now have a nice tidy dataframe of Maryland GOP gubernatorial primary results that we could ask some questions of.\nQuestion #1: \nThink back to last week’s pre-lab where we learned to load U.S. Census data from the Tidycensus package.

And you definitely can’t expect readers to do that, if you want to share the findings that support a story you’ve published.\nFortunately, working in Quarto markdown documents – .QMD files – allows us to easily publish a nice and tidy html page (or, if we prefer, a pdf or a word doc) with the results of our analysis. We can publish a page that contains text, tables, static or interactive visualizations, images, links and, if we want to show it, our code.\nThe process works like this:\nLet’s get an overview of the different parts of the QMD file, and then we’ll practice in another document.\nAt the top of the page is something we’ve seen in our templates for our major projects. It’s called “YAML”, and it provides styling and other information that will be included in the final html document we create.\nIn the example below, we’re providing a very bare bones set of YAML instructions. We’re giving our document a title, an author, a date (each time it’s run, the current date will be put in) and telling the document to output as html and use a built-in styling “theme” called cosmo.\nWe can also easily add a clickable table of contents and more, as this nice guide shows"
